# Luxury.AI - Next.js Landing Page

A premium AI platform landing page built with Next.js, featuring smooth animations and a luxury aesthetic.

## Design Decisions

**Visual Language**: Went with a dark, sophisticated palette (midnight black + gold accents) to convey premium quality. The minimal color scheme keeps focus on the content while the gold highlights add that luxury touch.

**Animations**: Mixed subtle particle fields with bold scroll-triggered reveals. The DNA helix loader sets expectations for something special, while the staggered text animations and floating shapes add depth without overwhelming. The "Experience" section uses scroll progress to create that cinematic reveal effect - it's a bit extra but that's the point.

**Typography**: Playfair Display for headlines (classic luxury vibes) paired with Inter for body text (clean, modern, readable). The letter-spacing on key elements gives it that high-end editorial feel.

**Interactions**: Custom cursor and magnetic buttons because luxury is in the details. The hover effects on cards and gallery items reward exploration. Everything responds to user input to feel alive and premium.

**Performance**: All animations use CSS transforms and opacity for smooth 60fps. The particle field is canvas-based but lightweight. Intersection Observer handles scroll animations efficiently.

Basically tried to capture that "expensive but effortless" feeling throughout. Like a high-end watch - complex underneath but simple on the surface.
